1.  Include header file "scp.h" in your project.
2.  Derive any relevant class in your spplication from "Concurrent" class.
3a. Create Shared Declarations: these are global variables discussed in programmers reference. 
3b. Create instances of your classes and pass shared declarations as parameters to constructors.
4.  Call initialization function from each object.
5.  Register resources calling register_resource(): global or local resources.
6.  Mark resources calling mark_resources(): these are the resources object will access durin execution of the program.
7.  Compile and run you application. All objects should now access resources they want.

8a.To compile application with g++ on Linux you must include path to /include directory where scp.h is and include path
   to /lib directory where concurrent.so resides and pass -lconcurrent as a parameter to g++. 
   
	For example:
   
	g++ -Wall -I/path/to/includes -L/path/to/libraries your_prog.cpp -lConcurrent -o your_prog_exec

8b. If you have copied header file scp.h to system's /include directory and concurrent.so to system's /lib directory, then
    you don't need to pass include and lib directories to compiler.

	For example:

	g++ -Wall your_prog.cpp -lConcurrent -o your_prog_exec
